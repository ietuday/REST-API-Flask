print(json_data)
print(Student(**json.loads(json_data)))


# The double asterisks ** in the Student(**json.load(json_data)
# line may look confusing. But all it does is expanding the
#  dictionary. In this case, it is equivalent to:
# d = json.loads(json_data)
# Student(first_name=d["first_name"], last_name=d["last_name"])
